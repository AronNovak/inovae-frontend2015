The goal is to create a web page HTML/CSS/Javascript following provided mockups. We provided the HTML skeleton into index.html where parts of the markup are ready to be themed, you don't have to change them, only add new code. We also provided the structure of stylesheets using SASS/Compass technologies that you need to modify and extend to apply mockups. Some Javascript will be needed, mostly for the slideshow, the accordion and the mobile menu.

In summary, the deliverable we expect is the "deliverable" folder we initially provided, with your added changes:
* The complete index.html
* The SCSS source files
* The CSS files
* The file for the Javascript scripts
* The 'fonts' folder
* The 'images' folder, with icons and images files into
* Included in one Git repository, make further commits on the existing repository available at: https://github.com/AronNovak/inovae-frontend2015.git
  * Make one commit per hour
  * Perform maximum 4 commits (in other words: stop after 4 hours)
  * As you have no push rights, in the end, simply compress (tar.gz / ZIP / 7z, but no GPG please) the local folder and send it as an attachment in response to the email you got the beginning of the timeslot.

 * If you see that you won't have time to finish the whole SASS part, then it's better to have some degree of readiness from the Javascript part too compared to a complete SASS without any Javascript.

Here are some additional specifications:
 * Icons must be in vector format for good rendering on retina screens.
 * The carousel needs to work with Owl Carousel JQUERY plugin (http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/).
 * The breadcrumb under the carousel is really long and you must find a way to always display it on one line. The text which exceeds the page should disappear behind a gradient background. The markup of this breadcrumb is provided and it ## must not be changed ##.
 * The accordion should consist of one title and one body per section. When one title is clicked the next following body opens and the others close. All should be closed by default. The markup of this accordion is provided and it ## must not be changed ##.
 * The behavior of the mobile menu is visible on this mockup: https://marvelapp.com/8caj23
 * Do not use any frameworks like bootstrap and do not use ready-to-use jQuery script.
